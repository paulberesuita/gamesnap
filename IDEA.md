# GameSnap

> Snap a photo of any board game, get instant simplified how-to-play guide

## Opportunity

Photo-first board game rules assistant. Existing AI tools (RulesBot.ai, Boardgamebot.AI) require typing the game name and give full rules. GameSnap lets you snap a photo (even if you don't know what game it is) and get a beginner-friendly quick-start guide.

## Why This

- Clear market gap: no photo-based game identification + simplified rules combo exists
- Pain is real: "Every Board Game Rulebook is Awful" essay went viral; YouTube tutorial channels have millions of subs
- Multiple use cases: game night, thrift store finds, visiting relatives, teaching kids
- "Shazam for board games" — instantly understandable pitch

## Type

App (PWA) + Website

## Distribution Angle

- **Phase 1:** Programmatic SEO on "how to play [game] simple" for top 1000 games
- **Phase 2:** Free tool — board game identifier from photo
- **Phase 3:** Core product — photo → simplified rules
- **Phase 4:** TikTok content — "POV: You found a game at Goodwill"

## Notes

- Competitors: RulesBot.ai, Boardgamebot.AI, Ludomentor, Watch It Played (YouTube)
- Tech: Vision API + RAG on rulebook database
- MVP: Top 100 games with pre-written quick-start guides
- Monetization: Free tier (5 scans/month) → Pro ($5/mo for unlimited)
